# Darknet for KITTI

This repository is forked from [pjreddie/darknet](https://github.com/pjreddie/darknet) and [yizhou-wang/darknet-kitti](https://github.com/yizhou-wang/darknet-kitti). 

# What's new for this repository? #

This version of darknet is modified to fit KITTI 2D object dataset and contains the pre-trained weights from training on IMAGENET and KITTI datasets. 

## Train YOLOv2 for KITTI ##

The details are written at http://yizhouwang.net/blog/2018/07/29/train-yolov2-kitti/.

## Object Detection on KITTI dataset using YOLO and Faster R-CNN ##

The details are written at http://yizhouwang.net/blog/2018/12/20/object-detection-kitti/.

## Test image sequence using YOLO ##

New function `testseq` in darknet is written for testing image sequence. The file names of the image sequence should be listed in a `txt` file `<namelist.txt>`. To use `testseq`, run the following code in the terminal:
```
./darknet detector testseq cfg/kitti.data cfg/kitti.cfg <weights_file> <namelist.txt>
```

New function `twseq` in darknet is written for testing image sequence and output results. The file names of the image sequence should be listed in a `txt` file `<namelist.txt>`. To use `twseq`, run the following code in the terminal:
```
./darknet detector twseq cfg/kitti.data cfg/kitti.cfg <weights_file> <namelist.txt> -thresh 0.5 -show 1
```
